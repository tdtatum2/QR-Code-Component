## Overview

This is a very simple project that introduces frontend developers to being given a design that needs to be brought to life. No advanced techniques are necessary, but it is a nice real-world example of how you might be asked to make a component for a project.

## My process

I started by inspecting the provided designs. I decided to use responsive containers, but maintain a set size for the actual card component that was to hold the QR Code image, the title, and the text. This is because I noticed that the card in the desktop design was "small" compared to the screen, but filled nearly the entire screen on mobile. After noting various important aspects (border-radius, text alignment, etc.) and determining that I would use a react-bootstrap Card component, I looked into the provided style guide. After initializing a new React app, I made sure to create variables to store the provided colours, as well as import the provided font family. Creating the variables to store colours made me more confident in my ability to match the design as closely as possible, and I always prefer to use variables when developing in case colour schemes change at some point. From there, it was as simple as plugging the image and information into the react-bootstrap Card component!
